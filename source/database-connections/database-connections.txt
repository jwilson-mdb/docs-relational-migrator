Relational Migrator uses JDBC connection strings and associated user
credentials to access your relational database and MongoDB deployment.
You can save this information as a database connection.

Use Cases
---------

You can save a new database connection:

- When creating a project from a live database connection

- When creating or modifying a data migration job

- From the :guilabel:`Database Connections Bar`` in a project

- From the Relational Migrator :guilabel:`Connections` page

After saving a database connection, you can use ot for any 
task that requires connecting to a database.

Supported Alternatives
----------------------

Relational Migrator can use Data Definition Language (DDL) files 
exported from your relational database to create a project when 
network connectivity or permissions to your relational database 
are a consideration.

Relational Migrator also provides a pre-defined relational database schema.
The sample schema allows you to try Relational Migrator even if you aren't
able to connect to a relational database.

These options allow you to create projects and map schemas without live 
database connections. However, Relational Migrator requires live connections
to perform data migrations.

For more information, see :ref:`<TODO>`

Get Started
-----------

To create, view, and manage saved connections, go to the Relational 
Migrator :guilabel:`Connections` tab.
